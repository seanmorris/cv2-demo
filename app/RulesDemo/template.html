<h2>rules</h2>

<p>The most basic rules simply map CSS selectors to callbacks. Whenever a tag matching a rule is encountered, the callback is applied.</p>

<p>Every View comes with a RuleSet, so you can add Rules by calling <code>this.ruleSet.add</code>.</p>

<h3>Global Rules</h3>

<p>The <code>RuleSet.add</code> method may be called statically to add global rules.</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<p>If <code>this.preRuleSet.add</code> is used rather than <code>this.ruleSet.add</code>, the rules will be appled BEFORE the template is processed, rather than after.</p>

<p>This allows the use of cv-* attributes.</p>

<h3>Mapping tags to tags</h3>

<p>If the callback returns an HTMLElement, the original tag will be replaced.</p>

<h3>Mapping tags to views</h3>

<p>View classes, or instances of them may both be passed instead of a callback. In this case, the view will be rendered <b>inside</b> the existing tag.</p>
