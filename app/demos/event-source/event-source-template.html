<p>EventSource aren't wrapped on the client side. However Curvature provides powerful functionality to generate HTTP SSE's with Services on both the client side in Serivice Workers, as well as on the server side via Cloud Services in environments like CloudFlare's edge workers.</p>

<h3>Local Events</h3>

<p>These events are being generated locally via a service worker. The worker is simulating an endpoint at <a href = "https://curvature.seanmorr.is/local-events" target = "_blank">https://curvature.seanmorr.is/local-events</a>.</p>
