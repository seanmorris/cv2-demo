	<p>When you click "ping", this page will ping the service worker, using <code>.postMessage()</code> under the hood. The worker should respond with a pong, and if there are any other tabs open to this same page, each one of should also respond separately to the ping with a "pong". Each page will be assigned a UUID, and will refer to eachother in the log below using this as an identifier.</p>
